Please, follow these instructions carefully to get ready **at least one day before the workshop**.

::: callout-important
Installing the necessary software takes a lot of space on your computer and can take a long of time (1-3 hours depending on the system).
:::

## Pre-requisites

Before installing the necessary software, make sure you have installed or updated the following software.

-   The **latest version of R** (<https://cloud.r-project.org>).

-   The **latest version of RStudio** (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>).

-   Your **operating system is up-to-date**.

## Starter Kit

I strongly recommend you to use the Starter Kit.

You can get the Starter Kit from [here](https://github.com/stefanocoretta/learnBayesKit). It is just an RStudio project with some useful files.

## Installation

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
If you have previously installed the C++ toolkit or if you have recently updated your OS, please follow these instructions to reinstall them.
:::

Now you will need to install a few packages and extra software.

Here is an overview of what you will install:

1.  C++ toolchain.

2.  R packages: tidyverse, brms, tidybayes, extraDistr.

### 1. Install the C++ toolchain

The package brms used in the workshop requires a working C++ toolchain to compile models.

#### Windows

For Windows, follow the instructions here: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html>

#### macOS

For macOS, open the Terminal and write the following line then press enter/return:

```         
xcode-select --install
```

You'll see a panel that asks you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Install them. Downloading and installation will take 30 to 60 minutes.

#### Linux

For Linux, follow the instructions here: <https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C-Toolchain-for-Linux>

### 2. Install the R packages

You need to install the following packages:

``` r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "brms", "tidybayes", "extraDistr"))
```

It will take several minutes to install the packages, depending on your system and configuration.

**If after opening the Starter Kit in RStudio you get asked to install extra packages or software, please do so.**

### Check your installation

Run the following in the RStudio Console:

``` r
example(stan_model, package = "rstan", run.dontrun = TRUE)
```

If you see some strange looking text printed in the Console and then `fit` and `fit2` in the Environment, then you are sorted!

## Troubleshoot

If you have issues with any of these steps, please get in touch with Stefano no later than two working days prior to the workshop.
