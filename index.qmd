title: "Learn Bayesian Linear Models in R"
---

This is the website of the workshop **learnBayes**.

Please, check the [Set-up](setup.qmd) page for important set-up instructions, before joining the workshop.

This workshop assumes you have a **solid command of R and tidyverse packages, and familiarity with linear modelling** (including interpreting coefficients and interactions, running linear models with binomial/Bernoulli family, aka logistic regression).

If you wish to revise any of these topics, we recommend the following resources:

-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) (online book).
-   [Statistics for Linguists in R](https://www.routledge.com/Statistics-for-Linguists-An-Introduction-Using-R/Winter/p/book/9781138056091) (texbook).
